# Visual Algorithm Designer 🎨🤖

Visual Algorithm Designer is a fun and easy-to-use app that lets you create, see, and run algorithms using a drag-and-drop interface. You can also use AI to help you make algorithms and fix visual problems. 😃✨

## Cool Features 🎉

- Make and manage algorithm steps
- Drag and drop steps to put them in order
- Run algorithms step-by-step and watch them in action
- Use AI to create algorithms
- Use AI to fix visual problems

## How to Start 🚀

Follow these steps to set up the project and run the development server.

### What You Need 🛠️

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher) or yarn (v1.22 or higher)
- Python 3.10.11

### Installation 📥

   yarn start
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app.

## How to Use 🕹️

### Making Algorithm Steps 🧩

1. Type a new step in the input box and click the "Add Step" button.
2. Drag and drop steps to put them in the right order.

### Running the Algorithm 🏃‍♂️

1. Click the "Run Algorithm" button to run the algorithm step-by-step.
2. The current step will be highlighted while running.

### Creating Algorithms with AI 🤖

1. Describe your algorithm in the input box under "Generate Algorithm with AI".
2. Click the "Generate Algorithm" button to let the AI create algorithm steps for you.

### Fixing Visual Problems with AI 🐞

1. Describe the visual problem you're having in the textarea under "Debug Visual Issues with AI".
2. Click the "Debug Issue" button to get suggestions from the AI to fix the problem.
